# Nursery Garden Management Web Application
This web application is designed to assist farmers in managing their nursery gardens efficiently and to facilitate interactions with agriculture companies.

## Key Features:

### Farmer Role:

- <b>Nursery Management:</b> Adjust temperature and water levels, organize seedling layout (with labeled free and occupied spots for seedling), add and remove seedlings, and plant new seedlings in available spots. Create new nursery gardens by specifying dimensions such as width and length.
- <b>Seedling Management:</b> Clicking on a chosen spot in the nursery garden layout allows farmers to manage seedlings. If the spot contains a seedling, a new window opens where the farmer can add products/fertilizers to the seedling and track its progress. Progress is measured based on the development of the seedling, with fertilizers increasing the progress. If the spot in the garden layout is empty, the farmer has the option to add new seedlings listed from their warehouse.
- <b>Product Ordering via Online shop:</b> Order products such as seedlings, fertilizers, and other agricultural supplies from registered agriculture companies.
- <b>Warehouse Management:</b> View and manage all supplies in the warehouse, including stock levels and storage information.
- <b>Order Tracking:</b> Track the status of their orders and manage their nursery garden supplies.
- <b>Ratings:</b> Rate the companies and their products based on satisfaction and quality.
- <b>Notifications:</b> Receive in-app and email notifications if the temperature drops below or if water levels fall below certain thresholds.
  
### Agriculture Company Role:

- <b>Product Offering:</b> Register and list products like seedlings, fertilizers, and other agricultural supplies.
- <b>Order Management:</b> Track received orders, manage deliveries, and assign delivery personnel.
- <b>Customer Interaction:</b> Facilitate communication and transactions with farmers and receive feedback through ratings.

### Admin Role:

- <b>User Management:</b> Add new users (farmers or companies) to the system, manage user roles, and handle user permissions.
  
This application aims to streamline nursery garden management for farmers and enhance the business operations of agriculture companies by providing a seamless platform for ordering, managing agricultural products, and enabling feedback through ratings and notifications.
